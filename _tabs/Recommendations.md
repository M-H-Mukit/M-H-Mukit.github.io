## 1: Muhi Khair

**Role:** Product Management & Growth, IT Consultant, System & Solution Architect, Technical Project Manager, Migration to Cloud  
**Date:** November 13, 2023  
**Working Relationship:** Muhi worked with Mehadi but they were at different companies

I had the pleasure of working with Mehedi on a project where we developed a REST web application with an independent backend and frontend. Despite being officially titled as a software developer, Mehedi's role extended far beyond coding. He seamlessly wore many hatsâ€”from virtual infrastructure to dev-ops, researching new tools and technologies, UI design, and more. Whenever faced with challenging tasks, he dove in and played a crucial role in problem-solving. Mehedi's enthusiasm for learning new tools and technologies, coupled with his quick adaptation to the project's evolving needs, showcases his versatility. A great team player, I look forward to our paths crossing again for future collaborations.
